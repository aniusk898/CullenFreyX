\title{Calculate Statistics for a Given Dataset}
\usage{
calculate_statistics(data, method = "unbiased")

calculate_statistics(data, method = "unbiased")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A numeric vector for which the statistics will be calculated. Must contain at least 4 data points.}

\item{method}{A string indicating whether to use "sample" or "unbiased" method for calculating statistics.}
}
\value{
A list containing calculated statistics such as minimum, maximum, mean, variance, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis.

A list with the following components:
\describe{
\item{min}{The minimum value of the data.}
\item{max}{The maximum value of the data.}
\item{mean}{The mean (average) of the data.}
\item{variance}{The variance (second data_moment) of the data.}
\item{sd}{The standard deviation of the data.}
\item{median}{The median of the data.}
\item{skewness}{The skewness of the data.}
\item{skewness_squared}{The square of the skewness.}
\item{kurtosis}{The kurtosis (excess kurtosis) of the data.}
}
}
\description{
This function is a generic method to calculate various statistics such as mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, and range for a given numeric dataset.

This function calculates key statistics such as skewness, kurtosis, minimum, maximum, mean, variance, and standard deviation for a numeric dataset.
The skewness and kurtosis are computed using standard formulas, with kurtosis representing the Fisher kurtosis (excess kurtosis).
}
\details{
The function dispatches based on the class of the input data and calculates statistics accordingly.
